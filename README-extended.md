# About me

Hi! üëãüèº I'm Dennis (he/him), based in the Netherlands. I'm an energetic and ambitious person driven by strong passion for the things I do. This extended README is for you to get a slightly better understanding of who I am and how I work and communicate.

## My core values

- Loyalty. I prefer a few deep connections over many superficial ones, but will approach everyone with kindness and respect.
- Passion. The greatest things can only be built when you give it your everything. Rest assured that when I join you on a project, I will put a lot of energy and dedication into it, and expect you to do the same.
- Health. I actively work out and try what food works best for my body. As a result, I'm feeling stronger, more focused and I sleep better. Tips are always welcome!
- Trust. I believe that strong relationships, both personal and at work, can only be built when there's 100% mutual trust and honesty. I will tell you when I feel that's not the case.
- Transparency. I share my thoughts publicly and with good intentions, as well as product roadmaps or things I'm working on. I hope this helps others to better understand where I'm coming from or what I'm working on.
- Listen. We tend to interrupt each other during conversations and not _actually_ listen. I will carefully listen to you and actively take notes when it's a lot of information to process.
- Optimism. Even when I'm having a bad day, I choose to look up and realize that the glass is always half full. There's already more than enough negativity in this world, don't you think?

## Dennis in communication

- I'm an open and transparent communicator. I choose public channels over private ones whenever possible, and actively move our conversations to public places when I think that's more appropriate (with your consent, of course).
- People sometimes find me overwhelming when I talk about my ambitions or goals. Please know that I do everything with positive intentions. Feel free to ask for more context/background if you don't fully get where I'm coming from.
- When we have a deep discussion, whether that is about work or private life, I often take notes. This helps me memorize things better and work out ideas that might have come up during our discussion. You will always have my full attention when we're in a conversation.
- I'm an active user of emoji üòÉ - it helps me express my feelings better and improves implicit communication in my experience. It's the little emoji that can help you tell whether I'm positive, neutral or negative about something. When I feel that I'm really missing context, I will invite you for a video call or an in-person meeting, as I can tell a lot from facial expressions and body language.
- I TEND TO USE CAPITAL LETTERS WHEN I'M EXCITED. Like when we have been working on a project for a long time and I'm proud of us delivering it. Don't worry; whenever we have a serious conversation or when we don't agree on something, I will be calm, polite and listening. I will always try to understand where you're coming from and see if we can find a middle way.

## What I ask from you in conversations

- Please bring anything to the table that's on your mind or bothering you. There are no "stupid questions" or "weird topics".
- Please be honest and direct in all your communication. I'd rather hear something "in my face" immediately than when it's too late for me to improve or do something about it.
- Please be fully present in the conversation. If that's not possible for whatever reason, let's reschedule. No hard feelings, I'd rather have you be 100% there!
- If you're not "being you" in your communication, I will very likely notice and tell you about it. Feel free to start a conversation with "Hey, I'm very low on energy today, but do feel that this is an important topic that can't wait". I will then do my best to support you, like taking notes and taking over some of your tasks.

## Things I'm working on

- I'm a [go-getter](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/go-getter). I will do whatever it takes to dive into complex challenges and find a solution. The good thing is that it helps me get a deep understanding of the topic at hand, but I tend to feel alone in that process. Even when there's a lot of expertise around me. I am trying to more actively ask for help, but if you do see me struggle, please feel invited to jump in so we can work together on it.
- Effectively saying "no" in a polite way. I'm having weekly sessions with my accountability partner to keep a close eye on my quarterly goals. This has led to much more focus in my work and private life, but also forces me to reprioritize things. I'm sometimes struggling to find the right words to tell someone that I'm having other priorities right now (saying no), but have been making steady progress in this area lately.
- Stop making assumptions. Like when we're in a discussion where we are missing some context or don't properly understand the consequences of our decisions yet. I am now able to identify when I start making assumptions to fill in the gaps. The next step is to eliminate those assumptions by speaking up and letting the other(s) explicitly define what they mean.
